# CSS utility code

This is how I used to write css code before tailwind. I always liked creating a set of utility classes and making the classname represent the css rule it was applying.

- [Global CSS](https://github.com/rakesh-gupta29/css-utils/tree/main/global-css) - Utility global modular SCSS code for small projects.
- [Reset CSS](https://github.com/rakesh-gupta29/css-utils/tree/main/reset-css) - CSS reset code.
